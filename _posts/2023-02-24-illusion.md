title:  "Illusion"
---

Even texture effects submit to the illusion of transparence<br>
Disorder leading to indefinite confusion of the essence<br>
What reflects the human nature in an intricate complexity<br>
Is what's bleeding through the pages with an uttermost necessity<br>
<br>
Puzzled by the mesmerizing ignorance of the enlightened ones<br>
Who pick up their pens and pencils like the soldiers who pick up their guns<br>
Praying to the traumatizing goddesses who terrorize their flock while<br>
Preying on inferiors who fall under their mock and foul hostile smile<br>
<br>
Meaningless calamities that occupy their minds<br>
Form dissolves in substance, gets lost between the lines<br>
Is there any reason for you to look inside?<br>
Just to find the horrors created by your mind.<br>
