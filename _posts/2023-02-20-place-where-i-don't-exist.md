title:  "Place Where I Don't Exist"
---

Is it warmer in the place where I don’t exist?<br>
Does the sun shine brighter there?<br>
If it is, then what makes it so?<br>
<br>
Why do you look in the mirror?<br>
What are you hoping to see?<br>
Who’s that stranger staring back?<br>
What if you switched places with them?<br>
<br>
Is your reality a distorted reflection<br>
Of something that's meant to be?<br>
Or is it as real as the text on the screen<br>
That was typed for amusement only?<br>
