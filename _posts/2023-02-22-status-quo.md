title:  "Status Quo"
---

Nothing ventured, nothing gained;<br>
Nothing done and nothing planned;<br>
Nothing said and nothing thought;<br>
Nothing taken, nothing brought.<br>
<br>
Doing anything? No thanks.<br>
Doing means that I will fail.<br>
Doing things requires change.<br>
Doing means things rearrange.<br>
<br>
I would rather stay in place.<br>
Doing nothing is okay.<br>
Stable is a place to be.<br>
I enjoy it, can't you see?<br>
<br>
You can go and chase your dream,<br>
If it makes you feel supreme.<br>
I will be where I belong,<br>
Where I have been all along.<br>
