title:  "A Special Place in Heaven"
---

If you wait for long enough,<br>
You will get what you deserve.<br>
Just stay silent, don't rebuff—<br>
Heaven's got a place reserved.<br>
<br>
Place where only patient go.<br>
Those who do anticipate.<br>
Place where you and I belong—<br>
Those who are deliberate.<br>
<br>
Sometimes things just need to pass,<br>
Sometimes waiting is the prize.<br>
Other times they'd better last.<br>
No one's waiting for demise.<br>
