title:  "Amy Likes Spiders"
---

Amy told me she likes spiders.<br>
She has even shown me one of them.<br>
Icky, wriggly, hairy, ugly spiders!<br>
But I'm still friends with her.<br>
<br>
Amy never told anyone about her spiders.<br>
She only wanted me to know this.<br>
I don't really get why she likes them.<br>
But I'm still friends with her.<br>
<br>
Amy has a lot of friends.<br>
She can't talk to them about her spiders.<br>
She's afraid they will not like that.<br>
But I'm still friends with her.<br>
<br>
She has other hobbies we can both enjoy.<br>
She keeps this one private.<br>
This one doesn't hurt anyone.<br>
<br>
I know she trusts me.<br>
Her trust means a lot to me.<br>
My world is better with her in it.<br>
<br>
And I'm not gonna tell anyone.
