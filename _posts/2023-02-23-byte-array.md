title:  "Byte Array"
---

Oh, trans-humanists, rejoiceâ€”<br>
It's your time to make a choice!<br>
This is not a chance to miss,<br>
You can be in endless bliss!<br>
<br>
Never heard before breakthrough<br>
Now available to you.<br>
Load your mind into device,<br>
For a reasonable price.<br>
<br>
All the gimmicks you can think,<br>
Once you press a key to sync.<br>
You won't need to eat or sleep.<br>
Well, and batteries are cheap!<br>
<br>
All the knowledge in the world,<br>
Solitaire, Excel and Word,<br>
E-mail, Internet, and more.<br>
Work or play, you won't get bored!<br>
<br>
What? Your body? Worry not!<br>
It will not be left to rot.<br>
It will have its application<br>
For the human population.<br>
<br>
Just don't think too much, okay?<br>
And just double tap to pay.<br>
You are only step away<br>
From becoming byte array.<br>
