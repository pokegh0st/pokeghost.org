                <h1>Amy Likes Spiders </h1>
                <p>27 February 2023 </p>
                <br>
                <p>Amy told me she likes spiders.<br />
She has even shown me one of them.<br />
Icky, wriggly, hairy, ugly spiders!<br />
But I’m still friends with her.<br />
<br />
Amy never told anyone about her spiders.<br />
She only wanted me to know this.<br />
I don’t really get why she likes them.<br />
But I’m still friends with her.<br />
<br />
Amy has a lot of friends.<br />
She can’t talk to them about her spiders.<br />
She’s afraid they will not like that.<br />
But I’m still friends with her.<br />
<br />
She has other hobbies we can both enjoy.<br />
She keeps this one private.<br />
This one doesn’t hurt anyone.<br />
<br />
I know she trusts me.<br />
Her trust means a lot to me.<br />
My world is better with her in it.<br />
<br />
And I’m not gonna tell anyone.</p>
