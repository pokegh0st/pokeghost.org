                <br>
                <p>Is it warmer in the place where I don’t exist?<br />
Does the sun shine brighter there?<br />
If it is, then what makes it so?<br />
<br />
Why do you look in the mirror?<br />
What are you hoping to see?<br />
Who’s that stranger staring back?<br />
What if you switched places with them?<br />
<br />
Is your reality a distorted reflection<br />
Of something that’s meant to be?<br />
Or is it as real as the text on the screen<br />
That was typed for amusement only?<br /></p>
