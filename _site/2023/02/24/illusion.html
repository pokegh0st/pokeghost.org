                <h1>Illusion </h1>
                <p>24 February 2023 </p>
                <br>
                <p>Even texture effects submit to the illusion of transparence<br />
Disorder leading to indefinite confusion of the essence<br />
What reflects the human nature in an intricate complexity<br />
Is whatâ€™s bleeding through the pages with an uttermost necessity<br />
<br />
Puzzled by the mesmerizing ignorance of the enlightened ones<br />
Who pick up their pens and pencils like the soldiers who pick up their guns<br />
Praying to the traumatizing goddesses who terrorize their flock while<br />
Preying on inferiors who fall under their mock and foul hostile smile<br />
<br />
Meaningless calamities that occupy their minds<br />
Form dissolves in substance, gets lost between the lines<br />
Is there any reason for you to look inside?<br />
Just to find the horrors created by your mind.<br /></p>
